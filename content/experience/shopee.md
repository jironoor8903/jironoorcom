### Description

- Developed a **REST API** service using **Go** for the backend of a mini marketplace application. Used **Redis** as Cache storage to store product list, and **JWT** for user authentication.
- With 2000 users and over 53 million product data, the system could support: **3103 qps** (browse list of products api) and **1330 tps** (login api), averaged **300ms** response time for all requests. **103%** improvement from previous version.
- Developed a configuration-driven framework to extend the pattern matching capability of **AWS EventBridge**, which **prevented thousands of false invocations of AWS Lambda functions**.
- Technologies: **Go, Javascript, API, Git, MySQL, K6**
